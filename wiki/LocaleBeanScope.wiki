= LocaleBeanScope=

The LocaleBeanScope is a Spring custom bean scope which can be configured by the CustomScopeConfigurer.

It will resolve a Locale using a LocaleResolver for every thread and will create a new single instance related to this Locale. Threads with the same locale will use the same Spring bean which is declared as locale scoped.

An example of the behavior can be found within  [http://code.google.com/p/utils-apl-derived/source/browse/trunk/utils-apl-derived/src/test/java/org/omnaest/utils/spring/LocaleBeanScopeTest.java LocaleBeanScopeTest] and the related application context at [http://code.google.com/p/utils-apl-derived/source/browse/trunk/utils-apl-derived/src/test/resources/org/omnaest/utils/spring/LocaleBeanScopeTestAC.xml LocaleBeanScopeTestAC]
